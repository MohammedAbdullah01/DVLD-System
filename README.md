5. **Education and Training**: Certificate of completion of driving training courses
6. **Tests**: Must pass all of the following tests in sequence:

   a. **Vision Test**:
   - Schedule an appointment and pay the fee ($10)
   - Record results (pass/fail) in the system
   - If failed, applicant must correct vision and schedule another test

   b. **Theoretical Test**:
   - Schedule after passing vision test and pay fee ($20)
   - Paper-based test outside the system
   - Record results and score out of 100 in the system

## License Issuance

After passing all tests and meeting all requirements, a driving license is issued with:

- License Number
- License Holder's Photo
- License Holder's National ID
- License Holder's Name
- License Holder's Date of Birth
- License Class
- Issue Date
- Expiry Date
- License Conditions (notes)
- License Issue Status (New, Lost Replacement, Damaged Replacement, Renewal)

The system allows querying licenses held by a person via their national ID or license number.

Once a license is issued to a person, they become an official driver in the system with an assigned number. This is added once, and all future licenses are linked to this driver record.
